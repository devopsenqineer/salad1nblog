# Introduction

This is my first blogpost. 

My name is devopsenqineer. I am currently a junior devops engineer in a company that does digitalisation and archiving of patient data. The team I am part of runs the production software. 

The production software processes patient data and is therefore a critical and essential process for the whole company. 

As part of my job, I am responsible for the staging environment. I use Terraform, Ansible and Powershell. 

I automate within the Azure cloud and occasionally on prem. I also give training on specific subjects. I like to work with the latest technology. 

In my blog I will write about automation in general, but also about technologies like Ansible or Terraform. 

I will also write about DevOps in general and about the Azure cloud. I will be creating tutorial series from time to time and making them available here. 

If there are any other topics that I am interested in, I will of course write about them as well.
