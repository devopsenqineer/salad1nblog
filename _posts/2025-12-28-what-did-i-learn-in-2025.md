# what did i learn as a devops engineer in 1 year

### New Company

I started my devops career switch from a heavily windows-based company to a linux and mac-os based company. I already worked with Terraform in my previous role as a junior devops engineer. ansible, powershell too. 

I won't give any informations on the company, but we're a SaaS company. 

### New Technologies & New Responsiblities 

I started the first time with working with: 

- macOS, 
- Kubernetes, 
- Docker, 
- Linux (RHEL, Rocky Linux), 
- Advanced Networking, 
- GitLab, 
- Bamboo & Bitbucket (onPrem) 
- Atlassian-Suite Administration, 
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for OpenTelekomCloud and AWS. 
- Python, 
- Cloudflare, 
- GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux)

I didn't work before with macOS so it was very new to me, but I liked it at the first time. After that i'll learned a many about kubernnetes. i also will post a dedicated blog on kubernetes only. also new was docker and linux for me. I already learned many concepts about networking and peering between two cloud sites. 

In the first 6 months i got the task, that our jira/confluence on prem instance gets migrated into the cloud.

I already worked before i switched the company with those tools and i also did some prepration for our migration which i also worked on in my previous compan during apprentinceship. 

So i did it and we're working in the atlassian cloud suite. i also made the permission sheme for our org. 

A other task which i worked on was designing with terraform a new k8s cluster in the opentelekomcloud. 

it contains:
- argocd
- vault
- ...

Also i got new responsibilties:
- managing cloud infrastructure
- IaC
- Networking Administration
- Atlassian Suite Administrationn

### Conclusion

I learned a much in this period and next year i will focus more on the programming aspect of my job. I liked it much and i will continue my path.
