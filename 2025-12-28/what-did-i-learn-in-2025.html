  <h1 id="what-did-i-learn-as-a-devops-engineer-in-1-year">what did i learn as a devops engineer in 1 year</h1>

<h3 id="new-company">New Company</h3>

<p>I started my devops career switch from a heavily windows-based company to a linux and mac-os based company. I already worked with Terraform in my previous role as a junior devops engineer. ansible, powershell too.</p>

<p>I won’t give any informations on the company, but we’re a SaaS company.</p>

<h3 id="new-technologies--new-responsiblities">New Technologies &amp; New Responsiblities</h3>

<p>I started the first time with working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>macOS,</li>
  <li>Kubernetes,</li>
  <li>Docker,</li>
  <li>Linux (RHEL, Rocky Linux),</li>
  <li>Advanced Networking,</li>
  <li>GitLab,</li>
  <li>Bamboo &amp; Bitbucket (onPrem)</li>
  <li>Atlassian-Suite Administration,</li>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for OpenTelekomCloud and AWS.</li>
  <li>Python,</li>
  <li>Cloudflare,</li>
  <li>GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux)</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t work before with macOS so it was very new to me, but I liked it at the first time. After that i’ll learned a many about kubernnetes. i also will post a dedicated blog on kubernetes only. also new was docker and linux for me. I already learned many concepts about networking and peering between two cloud sites.</p>

<p>In the first 6 months i got the task, that our jira/confluence on prem instance gets migrated into the cloud.</p>

<p>I already worked before i switched the company with those tools and i also did some prepration for our migration which i also worked on in my previous compan during apprentinceship.</p>

<p>So i did it and we’re working in the atlassian cloud suite. i also made the permission sheme for our org.</p>

<p>A other task which i worked on was designing with terraform a new k8s cluster in the opentelekomcloud.</p>

<p>it contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>argocd</li>
  <li>vault</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>Also i got new responsibilties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>managing cloud infrastructure</li>
  <li>IaC</li>
  <li>Networking Administration</li>
  <li>Atlassian Suite Administrationn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I learned a much in this period and next year i will focus more on the programming aspect of my job. I liked it much and i will continue my path.</p>
