  <h3 id="terraform-101---tutorial">Terraform 101 - Tutorial</h3>

<h4 id="terraform-basics">Terraform Basics</h4>

<p>So first of all Terraform is a Infrastructure as Code tool. You can create your infrastructure as code in many enviroments (e.g. aws, azure, gcp). With this you can improve standards within your company regarding infrastructure.</p>

<p>In many cases you want to have a fully automated setup of infrastructure, so you invest once your time learning it and then you can easily adopt making for example own modules.</p>

<h4 id="installation-of-terraform">Installation of Terraform</h4>

<p>For macOS
Using Homebrew:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap hashicorp/tap</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform</code>
To verify installation:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform -v</code></p>

<p>For Windows</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">choco install terraform</code></p>

<p>Option 2: Manual Installation
Go to the Terraform Downloads Page.</p>

<p>Download the Windows ZIP file.</p>

<p>Extract it to a folder (e.g., C:\Terraform).</p>

<p>Add that folder to your System PATH:</p>

<p>Open System Properties â†’ Environment Variables</p>

<p>Edit the Path variable and add C:\Terraform</p>

<p>To verify installation:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform -v</code></p>

<h3 id="4-phases">4 Phases</h3>

<p>With the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform init</code> you initialize terraform and if you use modules also loads the modules. In this phase it checks if the basic configuration is correct.</p>

<p>With the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform plan</code> you plan your infrastructure changes or creation of the infrastructure. It checks if all ressources are correct.</p>

<p>With the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform apply</code> you verify your plan and with this you start terraform building your infrastructure.</p>

<p>With the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform destroy</code> which is optional you can delete your infrastructure which you deployed before.</p>

<h3 id="tfstate---mind-of-your-infrastrucutre">TFState - Mind of your Infrastrucutre</h3>

<p>You need to know that after the third phase worked correctly it creates a tfstate file and there will be stored every infrastructure ressource and its the mind of your infrastructure. its the most important file within your configuration because there could be credentials stored etc. so you need to secure this file. In another tutorial i will go deeper into tfstate.</p>

<h3 id="example-which-you-easily-follow">Example which you easily follow</h3>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>

<p>You need to install Docker and of course terraform.</p>

<h4 id="maintf">main.tf</h4>

Initializing the backend...

- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~&gt; 3.0"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v3.6.2...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.6.2 (self-signed, key ID BD080C4571C6104C)
Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/plugins/signing
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
